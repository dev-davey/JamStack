The Challenges of a CMS when you are used to coding from scratch can be quite frustrating.  Having a deeper understanding of how everything is working together can be quite helpful, but can also work against you when you are trying to understand everything on a fundamental level.  Today my challenge is to be patient and gather a deeper understanding of my current CMS we are using at my job which is LifeRay.  I know that patience and persistence will pay off.
